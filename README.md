# Competition
The script masterScript.R contains a lot of models for African Soil Prediction challenge (held by Kaggle). 
However, this isn't the complete script or the final script and may contain some mistakes which I made while writing the script. The other files are from different competitions, however, these are mostly raw files (containing both valid and sometimes incorrect codes). I have not cleaned them up.
